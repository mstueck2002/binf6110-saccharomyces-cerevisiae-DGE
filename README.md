# BINF6110 Assignment 2: Using Bioinformatic Research Tools to Perform Differential Expression Analysis on the Bulk Transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

## Introduction

Sherry wines, originating from Spain, are distinctive fortified wines produced from the fermentation and maturation of several white grape varieties. [1] Spain is one of the world’s leading wine exporters (19.4%), and the Sherry Wine Region has 63 wineries dedicated solely to sherry production. [2, 3] Wine tourism is a significant economic driver for the country. [2] Research has demonstrated that winery and museum visits on wine tourism routes contribute to boosting regional competitiveness, enhancing residents’ quality of life, promoting environmental sustainability, and supporting wine production activities. [3] Specialized ‘flor’ strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* are fundamental to sherry production, determining both chemical composition and sensory properties through biological aging. [4] Investigating flor yeast biology is therefore essential for understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying sherry wine production and optimization. 

During biological aging, specialized sherry strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* form surface biofilms, commonly referred to as flor, on the wine. Under high-ethanol concentration conditions and with limited fermentable sugars available, flor yeasts exhibit adaptive mechanisms that promote growth and enhance stress-tolerance. [4] Transcriptome analyses of wine yeasts have revealed distinct gene regulatory responses to changing physiological and biochemical conditions during fermentation [5]. These differential expression patterns are closely associated with phenotypic variation among wine strains. [4]  The S. cerevisiae flor yeast strain I-329 was originally isolated from Spanish wine cellars and first described in a 1975 study by N.F. Saenko et al., which examined the scientific and technical aspects of sherry wine production. [6] The strain is preserved in the Magarach Collection of Microorganisms of Winemaking, and subsequent investigations have provided detailed microbiological, biochemical, and physiological characterization [6]. Given its relevance to sherry wine production, availability in yeast repositories, and well-characterized properties, strain I-329 represents a suitable model for transcriptomic analysis of flor yeast gene expression.

Effective transcriptomic analysis relies on accurate quantification of gene expression. Estimating transcript abundance from RNA-seq data relies on bioinformatic quantification algorithms that use either alignment-based (mapping to a reference) or alignment-free (pseudo-mapping) techniques to assign read fragments to transcript isoforms. [7] While alignment-based algorithms map sequencing reads to precise genomic coordinates, they are computationally expensive and exhibit limited scalability as data production increases. [8] Alignment-free algorithms address this limitation by estimating expression levels through transcript abundance calculations rather than resolving read-level genomic structure, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accurate transcript quantification. [8] The lightweight pseudo-mapping model, Salmon, produces scalable, high-quality transcript abundance estimates while simultaneously reducing technical biases commonly affecting transcript quantification. [8] Benchmarking analyses indicate that Salmon achieves superior accuracy, sensitivity, and computational efficiency relative to other popular quantification tools. [8] 

Following transcript abundance estimation, differential expression analysis can be performed to identify genes exhibiting significant changes in expression across stages or conditions. [9] This approach facilitates the detection of genes associated with specific biological pathways, pathological states, or treatment responses, offering insight into regulatory patterns and the molecular mechanisms driving observed phenotypes. [9] The selection of differential gene expression analysis tools depends on the statistical methodology employed, such as parametric versus nonparametric modelling, as well as dataset distributional assumptions. [9] Parametric frameworks are typically preferred for RNA-seq datasets, where expression counts are commonly assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution. [9] DESeq2 is a widely adopted parametric method that models RNA-seq count data using a negative binomial framework while incorporating shrinkage estimation to improve the stability and interpretability of dispersion and fold-change estimates [9]. This statistical framework enables robust and reproducible gene-level inference across diverse experimental designs while emphasizing the magnitude of differential expression rather than mere detection. [10] DESeq2 exhibits improved type-I error control and sensitivity compared with alternative count-based differential expression methods. [10]

Once differentially expressed genes have been identified, pathway enrichment analysis can be applied to evaluate their functional relevance [9]. Pathway enrichment analysis is a computational approach to determine whether specific biological pathways are statistically overrepresented within sets of differentially expressed genes or proteins, aiding interpretation of underlying biological processes and phenotypic associations. [9] Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) are classification systems which provide structured frameworks for gene annotation, function, cellular location and biological process involvement. [11] Organizing genes into functional and pathway-related groups supports broader biological interpretation beyond single-gene analysis. clusterProfiler is an R package designed to automate biological term classification and functional enrichment analysis for gene clusters, supporting human, mouse, and yeast species. [12] clusterProfiler overcomes manual, time-consuming approaches to functional annotation and enrichment, supports multi-cluster comparison and is integrated with visualization tools for comparative functional interpretation. [12]

This study evaluates a computational pipeline for transcriptomic analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* flor yeast gene expression using RNA-seq data generated under experimental conditions simulating biological wine aging. This work aims to advance understanding of flor yeast physiology and adaptive evolution while providing a molecular framework for optimizing sherry wine production and guiding future strain improvement strategies.
