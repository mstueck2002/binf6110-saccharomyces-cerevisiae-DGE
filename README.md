# BINF6110 Assignment 2: Using Bioinformatic Research Tools to Perform Differential Expression Analysis on the Bulk Transcriptome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

## Introduction

Sherry wines, originating from Spain, are distinctive fortified wines produced from the fermentation and maturation of several white grape varieties. [1] Spain is one of the world’s leading wine exporters (19.4%), and the Sherry Wine Region has 63 wineries dedicated solely to sherry production. [2, 3] Wine tourism is a significant economic driver for the country. [2] Research has demonstrated that winery and museum visits on wine tourism routes contribute to boosting regional competitiveness, enhancing residents’ quality of life, promoting environmental sustainability, and supporting wine production activities. [3] Specialized ‘flor’ strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* are fundamental to sherry production, determining both chemical composition and sensory properties through biological aging. [4] Investigating flor yeast biology is therefore essential for understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying sherry wine production and optimization. 

During biological aging, specialized sherry strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* form surface biofilms, commonly referred to as flor, on the wine. Under high-ethanol concentration conditions and with limited fermentable sugars available, flor yeasts exhibit adaptive mechanisms that promote growth and enhance stress-tolerance. [4] Transcriptome analyses of wine yeasts have revealed distinct gene regulatory responses to changing physiological and biochemical conditions during fermentation [5]. These differential expression patterns are closely associated with phenotypic variation among wine strains. [4]  The S. cerevisiae flor yeast strain I-329 was originally isolated from Spanish wine cellars and first described in a 1975 study by N.F. Saenko et al., which examined the scientific and technical aspects of sherry wine production. [6] The strain is preserved in the Magarach Collection of Microorganisms of Winemaking, and subsequent investigations have provided detailed microbiological, biochemical, and physiological characterization [6]. Given its relevance to sherry wine production, availability in yeast repositories, and well-characterized properties, strain I-329 represents a suitable model for transcriptomic analysis of flor yeast gene expression.

Effective transcriptomic analysis relies on accurate quantification of gene expression. Estimating transcript abundance from RNA-seq data relies on bioinformatic quantification algorithms that use either alignment-based (mapping to a reference) or alignment-free (pseudo-mapping) techniques to assign read fragments to transcript isoforms. [7] While alignment-based algorithms map sequencing reads to precise genomic coordinates, they are computationally expensive and exhibit limited scalability as data production increases. [8] Alignment-free algorithms address this limitation by estimating expression levels through transcript abundance calculations rather than resolving read-level genomic structure, reducing computational overhead while maintaining accurate transcript quantification. [8] The lightweight pseudo-mapping model, Salmon, produces scalable, high-quality transcript abundance estimates while simultaneously reducing technical biases commonly affecting transcript quantification. [8] Benchmarking analyses indicate that Salmon achieves superior accuracy, sensitivity, and computational efficiency relative to other popular quantification tools. [8] 

Following transcript abundance estimation, differential expression analysis can be performed to identify genes exhibiting significant changes in expression across stages or conditions. [9] This approach facilitates the detection of genes associated with specific biological pathways, pathological states, or treatment responses, offering insight into regulatory patterns and the molecular mechanisms driving observed phenotypes. [9] The selection of differential gene expression analysis tools depends on the statistical methodology employed, such as parametric versus nonparametric modelling, as well as dataset distributional assumptions. [9] Parametric frameworks are typically preferred for RNA-seq datasets, where expression counts are commonly assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution. [9] DESeq2 is a widely adopted parametric method that models RNA-seq count data using a negative binomial framework while incorporating shrinkage estimation to improve the stability and interpretability of dispersion and fold-change estimates [9]. This statistical framework enables robust and reproducible gene-level inference across diverse experimental designs while emphasizing the magnitude of differential expression rather than mere detection. [10] DESeq2 exhibits improved type-I error control and sensitivity compared with alternative count-based differential expression methods. [10]

Once differentially expressed genes have been identified, pathway enrichment analysis can be applied to evaluate their functional relevance [9]. Pathway enrichment analysis is a computational approach to determine whether specific biological pathways are statistically overrepresented within sets of differentially expressed genes or proteins, aiding interpretation of underlying biological processes and phenotypic associations. [9] Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) are classification systems which provide structured frameworks for gene annotation, function, cellular location and biological process involvement. [11] Organizing genes into functional and pathway-related groups supports broader biological interpretation beyond single-gene analysis. clusterProfiler is an R package designed to automate biological term classification and functional enrichment analysis for gene clusters, supporting human, mouse, and yeast species. [12] clusterProfiler overcomes manual, time-consuming approaches to functional annotation and enrichment, supports multi-cluster comparison and is integrated with visualization tools for comparative functional interpretation. [12]

This study evaluates a computational pipeline for transcriptomic analysis of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* flor yeast gene expression using RNA-seq data generated under experimental conditions simulating biological wine aging. This work aims to advance understanding of flor yeast physiology and adaptive evolution while providing a molecular framework for optimizing sherry wine production and guiding future strain improvement strategies.

## Methods
### Sequencing Data Acquisition

Transcriptome analysis of the *S. cerevisiae* flor yeast strain I-329 during biological wine aging and flor maturation was performed using nine RNA samples collected across three sampling points, each with three replicates. RNA extraction, purification, mRNA library preparation, and sequencing were conducted according to the methods described by Mardanov et al. (2020). SRA accession files for the nine samples were retrieved from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive using the SRA Toolkit and converted to FASTQ format. Sequencing quality for each sample was assessed using FastQC, which generated summary metrics including per-base sequence quality, GC content, sequence duplication levels, and potential adapter contamination. FastQC output reports were aggregated into a dataframe using the fastqcr R package and summarized for analysis. 

### Transcript Abundance Estimates 

A Salmon reference index was generated using the NCBI genome assembly ASM304674v transcriptome fasta for S. cerevisiae strain I-329. Using a FASTA-formatted reference transcriptome, Salmon can quickly infer the probable origin and orientation of sequencing reads, supporting reliable mapping and transcript abundance estimation. Transcript abundance estimations for each sample were quantified using Salmon quasi-mapping mode against the pre-built Salmon index (-i salmon_index). Library type was automatically inferred (-l A), allowing Salmon to detect read orientation without prior specification. Single-end reads were supplied using the -r option, and quantification results for each sample were written to separate output directories. Salmon-based analysis enabled rapid, alignment-free estimation of transcript-level expression while correcting for sequence-specific and GC-content biases inherent to RNA-seq data. [8]

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Transcript abundance estimates were imported into R using the *tximport* package. Transcript-level quantifications generated by Salmon were summarized into gene-level count and abundance matrices for downstream differential gene expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, which models RNA-seq count data using a negative binomial generalized linear model. [9] Statistical significance for pairwise comparisons was assessed using the Wald test. Raw gene counts were extracted to calculate the number of genes with detectable expression. Dispersion was visualized using the plotDispEsts() function to examine the mean-variance expression relationship. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on variance-stabilized expression values to evaluate global sample variance and assess replicate consistency across biofilm stages

Shrinkage estimation was applied to improve the stability and interpretability of dispersion and log2 fold-change estimates. Gene-level statistical inference was conducted across sample stages. Differential expression results from each pairwise comparison were extracted and filtered using an adjusted p-value threshold (padj < 0.05). Log2 fold-change shrinkage was applied using the ‘apeglm’ method before downstream interpretation. Genes meeting the significance criteria (padj < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1) were classified as upregulated, downregulated, or not significant for visualization. MA plots, volcano plots and heatmaps were used for visual representation of differential gene expression. 

A likelihood ratio test (LRT) implemented in DESeq2 was used to identify genes exhibiting significant expression variation across biological wine aging stages. Genes meeting the significance threshold (padj < 0.05) were retained for downstream analysis. Variance-stabilized expression values were then used as input to the degPatterns() function from the DEGreport package to cluster genes via shared expression patterns across stages. Cluster-specific gene expression trajectories were plotted for pattern visualization. 

### Functional Analysis

The NCBI ASM304674v transcriptome FASTA for *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain I-329 was annotated using strain-specific locus tags and protein identifiers, which are not directly compatible with established functional annotation classification systems indexed using standardized reference gene identifiers. To enable downstream functional analyses, translated coding sequences were mapped to reference gene identifiers via sequence similarity. Protein sequences derived from the strain I-329 transcriptome were aligned against the *S. cerevisiae* S288C reference proteome using BLASTP to identify putative orthologs.

The *S. cerevisiae* strain S288C, as the first yeast strain to have its genome sequenced, serves as the basis reference genome for yeast gene nomenclature and functional annotation systems. [14] Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) gene entries are indexed using identifiers derived from the NCBI yeast reference genome corresponding to strain S288C. 

Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were performed using Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) implemented in the R package clusterProfiler using the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) classification systems. Enrichment analyses were conducted on differentially expressed genes identified from DESeq2 stage-specific pairwise comparisons, as well as on cluster-specific gene expression trajectories derived from the DESeq2 likelihood ratio test (LRT) analysis. Pairwise enrichment analyses were used to examine stage-specific biological differences and the mechanistic processes associated with stage-discrete transitions. In addition, enrichment analyses of LRT-derived clusters were performed to understand expression trajectories across stages, providing a systems-level interpretation of gene expression dynamics across biological wine aging.
